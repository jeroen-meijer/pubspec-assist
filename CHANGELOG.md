## 2.2.0 - 2020-10-06

### Added

- Functionality to add multiple packages in once query.

### Fixed

- Using the `autoAddPackage` option now automatically picks the first package that has the exact same name as the search query.

- Removed old text parser.

### Fixed

- Fixed several bugs where the extension would crash when adding dependencies to an empty pubspec or empty `(dev_)dependencies`.
